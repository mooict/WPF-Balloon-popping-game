# WPF C# Tutorial – Create a fun Balloon popping game in visual studio


Welcome to this fun tutorial from MOO ICT, in this tutorial I will show you how to make a simple yet fun balloon popping game inside of visual studio with WPF and C#. in this project we will use rectangles, labels, timer and also audio to make a full prototype of a simple game that you can use for your own projects in the future. 

This program uses simple WPF and C# syntaxes and we don’t need to use any other complicated libraries or third-party frameworks to make. We will be using out own custom functions, click events and timer events to make this game run. All we are doing is simply creating new balloons for the canvas and animating them to top of the screen and when the player clicks on one we will add 1 to the score and when we don’t click on one and it reaches top of the screen we will add 1 to the miss. This way we will have a way for the player to keep playing the game and also to have a way to end the game as well. With each click we will use the Media Player class to load an MP3 file from our directory and then play it, by using sound effects we can make the game more engaging to the players and we don’t have to do any visual effects. 

This game is a perfect stepping stone for beginner programmers who want to learn about programming in C# and WPF. I hope you all enjoy this tutorial and I will see you on the next one, until then happy programming.
